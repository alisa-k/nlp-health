Motivational interviewing (MI) is an efficacious treatment for substance use disorders and other problem behaviors. Studies on MI fidelity and mechanisms of change typically use human raters to code therapy sessions, which requires considerable time, training, and financial costs. Natural language processing techniques have recently been utilized for coding MI sessions using machine learning techniques, rather than human coders, and preliminary results have suggested these methods hold promise. The current study extends this previous work by introducing two natural language processing models for automatically coding MI sessions via computer. The two models differ in the way they semantically represent session content, utilizing either 1) simple discrete sentence features (DSF model) and 2) more complex recursive neural networks (RNN model). Utterance- and session-level predictions from these models were compared to ratings provided by human coders using a large sample of MI sessions (N=341 sessions; 78,977 clinician and client talk turns) from 6 MI studies. Results show that the DSF model generally had slightly better performance compared to the RNN model. The DSF model had "good" or higher utterance-level agreement with human coders (Cohen's kappa>0.60) for open and closed questions, affirm, giving information, and follow/neutral (all therapist codes); considerably higher agreement was obtained for session-level indices, and many estimates were competitive with human-to-human agreement. However, there was poor agreement for client change talk, client sustain talk, and therapist MI-inconsistent behaviors. Natural language processing methods provide accurate representations of human derived behavioral codes and could offer substantial improvements to the efficiency and scale in which MI mechanisms of change research and fidelity monitoring are conducted.
The reconstruction of complex lower leg and foot defects is difficult for plastic surgeons. The distally based sural flap (DBSF) is an option for non-free flap lower leg reconstruction. However, one of the major drawbacks of the DBSF is its aesthetically non-acceptable donor area scarring.Eight patients (six men and two women) who had lower leg or foot defects were evaluated in this study. We used an ipsilateral or cross-leg DBSF to repair the defect. A medial or lateral gastrocnemius perforator island flap (average size 8.1 × 6.1 cm) was used to cover the donor area of the DBSF in a two-stage operative procedure.We did not observe any complications with the gastrocnemius perforator island flap. Two patients had local infections under the DBSF and were treated with bacteria-specific antibiotherapy. All patients were followed up for 1 year postoperatively. The donor areas of the distally based sural flaps were aesthetically acceptable. Patients gained ambulatory status during the follow-up period.Reconstruction of the donor area of a DBSF with a gastrocnemius perforator island flap allows for more acceptable aesthetics and functional results than do other reconstructive procedures.
This paper examines consumers' knowledge and lifestyle profiles and preferences regarding two environmentally labeled food staples, potatoes and ground beef. Data from online choice experiments conducted in Canada and Germany are analyzed through latent class choice modeling to identify the influence of consumer knowledge (subjective and objective knowledge as well as usage experience) on environmentally sustainable choices. We find that irrespective of product or country under investigation, high subjective and objective knowledge levels drive environmentally sustainable food choices. Subjective knowledge was found to be more important in this context. Usage experience had relatively little impact on environmentally sustainable choices. Our results suggest that about 20% of consumers in both countries are ready to adopt footprint labels in their food choices. Another 10-20% could be targeted by enhancing subjective knowledge, for example through targeted marketing campaigns.
